Botchain keeps you informed about the price of your favorite cryptocurrencies! With Botchain, you can set up alerts for
specific cryptocurrencies and get DM'ed when the price (or some other statistic) reaches a certain threshold. This is
particularly useful for traders and investors who need to keep a close eye on the markets.

Ease-of-use is our top priority, so most of the user interface is point-and-click (**no commands with weird syntaxes!**)

To get started, run /help for a tutorial on how to use the bot.
